Great! You're almost there. Since you've already done git init and have a .gitignore, here is the full step-by-step guide to push your project to GitHub using Git Bash:

ðŸš€ Step-by-Step: Push Project to GitHub

âœ… Step 1: Add all files
git add .

âœ… Step 2: Commit your changes
git commit -m "First commit"

âœ… Step 3: Create a new repository on GitHub
Go to https://github.com.
Click New Repository.
Enter:

Repository name (e.g., alliedge)

Keep it public/private as you want

DO NOT initialize with README (you already have one)

Click Create repository.


âœ… Step 4: Connect your local repo to GitHub
Copy the URL GitHub gives you (e.g., https://github.com/yourusername/alliedge.git) and run:

git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/alliedge.git



âœ… Step 5: Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main

âœ… Done! ðŸŽ‰
Now your project is live on GitHub!
git status
